# Route Start Performance

### List Tab
The route start performance report is used to generate reports about start timings of the routes using the assigned assets (such as GPS). This will provide the user with all the information about scheduled start times and the variance with the actual start times to record and potentially correct any deviations that are persistent. The user has the option to download the report in <img src='/img/csv-btn.png' height='20px' width='40px'/>, <img src='/img/pdf-btn.png' height='20px' width='40px'/> and <img src='/img/excel-btn.png' height='20px' width='40px'/> formats.
